# Assignment 4

1. Import training data provided in Assignment_4_Data_and_Template.xlsx
2. Use the training data to build two linear classifiers: (i) a binary classifier, and (ii) a multiclass classifier capable of distinguishing between 6 classes. The sheet titled "Training Data" contains the target class labels (Failure and Type). Use the pseudoinverse method of building linear classifiers. Paste your classifiers in the correct format as shown in the sheet titled "Classifiers"
3. Apply the classifiers to the data provided in the sheet "To be classified." Paste the results into the sheet.
4. Evaluate the performance of your classifiers using the metrics requested in the sheet "Performance"

For guidance, see slides titled "Step-by-step: Linear Classifier Design" in the lecture on linear classifiers.
